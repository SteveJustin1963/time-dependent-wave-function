# time-dependent-wave-function

Ψ(x,t) = Ae^(-iωt)e^(i * k * x)

This equation represents a time-dependent wave function in the position representation. The variable x represents the position of the particle, t represents time, and Ψ(x,t) represents the wave function at time t. The variable A represents a constant coefficient, and the variable ω represents the angular frequency of the wave.

The term e^(-i * ω * t) represents the time-dependent phase of the wave function, and the term e^(i * k * x) represents the spatial dependence of the wave function. Together, these terms describe how the wave function evolves in both time and space.

## Calculate 
the wave function at time t = 2 seconds, given A = 3, ω = 4, and k = 2.

Solution:

Plugging in the values into the wave function equation, we get:

Ψ(x,t) = 3e^(-i * 4 * 2)e^(i * 2 * x)
= 3e^(-8i)e^(2ix)
= 3e^(-8i)cos(2x) + 3e^(-8i)isin(2x)

Thus, the wave function at time t = 2 seconds is:

Ψ(x,2) = 3e^(-8i)cos(2x) + 3e^(-8i)isin(2x)
